A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

*Introduction*
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator App is a mobile application designed to help users calculate their BMI and understand their body weight status. It provides a convenient way to assess whether their weight falls within a healthy range based on their height, weight, age, and gender.

Features
1. BMI Calculation
Users can input their weight in kilograms, height in centimeters, age, and gender.
The app calculates the BMI based on the provided data.
2. BMI Classification
The app categorizes the BMI into predefined ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity, based on standard guidelines.
3. Status and Remarks
Users receive a status label (e.g., "Normal," "Underweight," "Obesity") based on their calculated BMI.
Customized remarks provide additional information about their BMI category.
The status label is color-coded for easy identification.
4. Age-Based Assessment
For users below the age of 18, the app provides BMI classification based on age-appropriate percentiles.
5. Result Saving
Users have the option to save their BMI calculation results.
6. Re-Calculation
Users can easily re-calculate their BMI by navigating back to the input page.
