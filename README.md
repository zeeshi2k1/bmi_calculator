A new Flutter project.

# Introduction
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator App is a mobile application designed to help users calculate their BMI and understand their body weight status. It provides a convenient way to assess whether their weight falls within a healthy range based on their height, weight, age, and gender.

# Features
## 1. BMI Calculation
Users can input their weight in kilograms, height in centimeters, age, and gender.
The app calculates the BMI based on the provided data.
## 2. BMI Classification
The app categorizes the BMI into predefined ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity, based on standard guidelines.
## 3. Status and Remarks
Users receive a status label (e.g., "Normal," "Underweight," "Obesity") based on their calculated BMI.
Customized remarks provide additional information about their BMI category.
The status label is color-coded for easy identification.
## 4. Age-Based Assessment
For users below the age of 18, the app provides BMI classification based on age-appropriate percentiles.
## 5. Result Saving
Users have the option to save their BMI calculation results.
## 6. Re-Calculation
Users can easily re-calculate their BMI by navigating back to the input page.
